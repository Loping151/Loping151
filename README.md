I am Loping151.

An undergraduate student studying Computer Vision, and is interested in AI applications.

I developed my own [website](https://loping151.com) for fun. Welcome.

I support open-source or dev-friendly products, i.e. Android, Linux, SteamDeck, JingPad, and Mistral... 

I am not a fan of Apple unless they open-source iOS one day.

My email: wangkailing151@gmail.com (as long as this account is alive), wkl@loping151.com (as long as the [website](https://loping151.com) is available) or wangkailing151@sjtu.edu.cn (before 2025.6 as I graduate).
